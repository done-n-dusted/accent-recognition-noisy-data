# accent-recognition-noisy-data
This project aims to create a classification model that can classify accents even when the recording is noisy. Noisy data with background noises correspond to real-life in-the-wild scenarios. Building a robust noise-resistant accent recognition model can prove to be essential in making many personalized applications possible.
